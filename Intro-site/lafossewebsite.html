            Hello! My name is Cass (he/they). I'm looking forward to getting to know you all better, but in the meantime, here's a little about me.
            <br><br>
            I am a strategy and communications professional with a background in journalism, public relations, and corporate advocacy. I have worked in and with a variety of organisations, from global media companies to grassroots campaign groups, and have experience in sectors from finance and technology, to advertising and human rights.
            <br><br>
            My area of expertise is in business culture and change management: I help my clients to develop and implement programmes that strengthen their employee voice structures and public posture on social justice issues. I am particularly interested in the societal role and responsibility of business, and how companies can use their influence to drive meaningful positive change.
            <br><br>
            Besides my work, I'm a gamer and huge fantasy/sci-fi dork, with a penchant for RPGs and a very, <i>very</i> large pile of books to read - and one to write - this year!
        </p2>

        <h3>
            Skills
        </h3>

        <p2>
            I've built a range of skills over my career, including:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Strategic communications: </b>I'm well versed in building strategic messaging that compels and engages audiences on issues like CSR, responsible journalism and hate crime.</li>
            <li><b>Research: </b>my first professional role was as a researcher in investigative journalism, and since then I've applied that investigative capability to my client work.</li>
            <li><b>Writing & editing: </b>my success so far has hinged on my ability to express myself in word and speech, as well as to communicate complex topics to a diversity of audiences.</li>
            <li><b>Project management: </b>most of my work has been project-based, and I've completed extensive projects to the satisfaction of clients like the Wellcome Trust, PepsiCo, Hitachi and McLaren.</li>
            <li><b>Consultancy & advisory: </b>I'm a fixer of problems, able to take in the full picture of a nuanced challenge - its risks and opportunities - and provide judged advice on addressing root causes and end consequences.</li>
            <li><b>Public speaking: </b>as the image hopefully illustrates, I've been able to leverage background in theatre to become a confident public speaker, interviewer and presenter.</li>
            <li><b>Advocacy & campaigning: </b>some of the key attributes needed to be an effective advocate - coalition-building, making a lot from a little, resilience to oppoisition and setbacks.</li>
            <li><b>Leadership: </b>I manage teams and projects like a scrum master, serving as architect, mentor and therapist; my focus is on facilitating collaboration, addressing risks and issues while providing the team with an overarching vision of and approach to the work. </li>
            <li><b>Client engagement: </b>my clients have gone on record to describe me as "collaborative, hard-working, reliable, caring and humorous", with "superior client management" and "excellent listening and facilitation skills". </li>
        </ul>
